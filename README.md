# Mystic Click

Astrology meets mysticism in the aesthetic for this rather tricky version of the beloved "Memory" game

## How to Play

The idea is to only click ONCE on each of the 12 images. Sound simple? Just wait! The images shuffle around after each click. Do your best to remember which of the arcane images you've already selected.
